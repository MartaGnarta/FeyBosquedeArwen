# Fey y el Bosque de Arwen

"Fey and the Forest of Arwen" is an action-adventure game where players control Fey, tasked with rescuing the forest from a corrupting force. Armed with magical gems from a sacred tree, Fey ventures into the most affected areas of the forest to halt the invasion of dark enemies. 

Developed as a final project by three classmates, the game was built using JavaScript and the Phaser library, along with PHP for backend functionality. The game includes a login and registration system, allowing players to resume their progress through a database using MySQL.

Unfortunately, the game is no longer hosted and cannot be played anymore. Due to the end of the hosting service and the project's conclusion, the game is now offline. However, I have shared a video showcasing the full gameplay of the game, so you can still experience the adventure and see how Fey battles to save the forest from corruption. The video captures the entire journey, from the initial mission to the final moments of the game.
