# Fey y el Bosque de Arwen

"Fey and the Forest of Arwen" is an action-adventure game where players control Fey, tasked with rescuing the forest from a corrupting force. Armed with magical gems from a sacred tree, Fey ventures into the most affected areas of the forest to halt the invasion of dark enemies. Developed as a final project by three classmates, the game was built using JavaScript and the Phaser library, along with PHP for backend functionality. The game includes a login and registration system, allowing players to resume their progress through a database. The majority of the game's art and programming were created by the developers themselves, showcasing their skills in both design and coding.
